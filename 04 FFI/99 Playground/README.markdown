# FFI Playground

## Goals

To show off some of the FFI (calling JavaScript from PureScript) features.

## Background

This is much more freeform an exercise than the rest. If you get this far, and the comments don't make
sense to you, stick your hand up and we'll go through it on the screen.

## Exercise

* Like the Pux examples, use `npm run start` to kick this off in a terminal.

* Open up both `src/Audio.purs` and `src/Audio.js`, read the comments, and have a mess around.
